# Cracking the Coding Interview: Object Oriented Programming
This is the code repository for Cracking the Coding Interview: Object Oriented Programming. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Are you afraid of your interview and want to practice before the final day? This course will be a perfect guide for you and will help you nail questions in your coding interview related to the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm. We have adopted a language-agnostic approach for our course, with JavaScript as our main language. 
This course sets out to provide developers with the necessary tools to ace their next interview by providing insights into advanced JavaScript concepts, using one of the best-known programming paradigms over the last 40 years in software development. This course will strengthen your foundations in that area and supply practical questions that will serve as a teaser for the kind of questions expected in a coding interview. You will learn how OOP has advantages which incorporate modularity and reusability. 
After each section, you’ll have a task which will help you gain confidence in the OOP paradigm. By the end of the course, you will be confident enough to nail any questions on the OOP paradigm that can be asked during a technical interview.
